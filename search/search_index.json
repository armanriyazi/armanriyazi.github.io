Such a feature allows for flexibility in the Polkadot ecosystem where every Parachain can create its own set of rules Basically, Polkadot Parachain Auctions are automated candle auctions (with some adjustments relevant to blockchain technology). It means that there is an opening period and an ending period. At any moment the winner can be chosen but we will only find it out at the end. It is not easy to get access to the Polkadot Relay Chain, and, currently, Parachains prefer to use crowdloan mechanism to collect funds to participate in Polkadot Parchain Auctions. To participate in the PolkadotParachain Auction and compete for a slot, prospective Parachains can bid in two ways: Parachains can bid their own DOT, through a single account * Parachains can use crowdloans to crowdsource DOT and bid it in the auctions * Users cannot participate in the Polkadot Parachain Auction directly. Users can only participate indirectly via crowd loans by contributing and locking DOT. Shared security and processing of transactions don\u2019t come for free. One of the ways to access them is to lease a slot on the Relay Chain. Projects compete to place the highest bid to get the slot. The first Polkadot Parachain Auction winner, via the process known as Crowdloan Campaign, raised 32.5 million DOT (around 1.3 billion USD at that time) to lease the slot for two years. A Parachain slot is a scarce resource. Given an increase in the number of Parachains, every few months new Parachains slots will be added. The Polkadot ultimate goal is to have 100 slots. @crowdsale-VS-crowdloan crowdsale and crowdloan which makes sense because they sound the same. they are similar but there are some very key differences for example crowdsale I am sure you're familiar with it's kind of like platforms along the lines of kickstarter so you fund a project say creating a backpack that sings and lights up and then you give the funds to eventually get the product knowing that it's not created yet and then the creator uses those funds to make the product and then eventually you'll get that product in the mail so you are buying an actual thing and then you get that thing but you never get your original funds back where a crowdloan is very different so you're finding a specific function for example a parachain slot and it can only be used for that purpose it can't be used for anything else and then all funds that you contribute are delivered back to you once the lease is up so anything you contributed originally comes right back to you and it's not like you're putting funds down and you never see them again but you get something else in return and so parachain teams don't have control over the funds it's locked in the relay chain which prevents rug pull so all of a sudden funds can't just disappear or someone takes all of them it's pretty much impossible for that to happen and then if the first attempt to score slot isn't successful the crowd loan continues to try to score a parachain slot in the next round and then the next round until they do and all crowdloans do have an expiration date and that will all be specified in the outset so you should never be left in the dark you'll always have all the information you need so you can look forward to all the exciting things to come. the other thing to keep in mind is some projects have a rewards cap for their crowd loans so they can only give out so many rewards or they can only take so many contributions to the crowd loan or a certain amount so if you are set on wanting to participate it's always good to do it as soon as you feel ready um just in case you know there's a cut off or in case you can get bonus rewards. @ParachainAcution-vs-eBayAcution a common misconception in the cryptocurrency space is that a para chain slot auction is something that you have to actively participate in kind of like an auction on ebay but that actually couldn't be further from the truth and all you have to do is contribute you don't have to bid and the crowdloan does on behalf of the project so there's no stress for you and then there's a difference between a regular auction and then a parachain slot option which is used to decide which pair of chains get to be connected to the relay chain so it's not like bidding on ebay for a handbag or something like that and then there's the concept of a candle auction which means in the ending period which is the last five days the auction can just end at any time and no one knows when this will be no single human knows and it's completely automated and a mystery to everyone and so the crowdloan opens before the auction starts and it stays open until a winner is declared so definitely make sure to contribute while the crowd loan is still open and hopefully before your team scores a slot and you get lots of rewards. There is also the possibility of a malicious bidder or a block producer trying to grief honest bidders by sniping auctions. For this reason, Vickrey auctions, a variant of second price auction in which bids are hidden and only revealed in a later phase, have emerged as a well-regarded mechanic. For example, it is implemented as the mechanism to auction human readable names on the ENS. The Candle auction is another solution that does not need the two-step commit and reveal schemes (a main component of Vickrey auctions), and for this reason allows smart contracts to participate. Polkadot will use a random beacon based on the VRF that's used also in other places of the protocol. The VRF will provide the base of the randomness, which will retroactively determine the end-time of the auction. 1) Slot Action compatition(Weekly) 2) if Won then 3) Parachain Lease Relay chain (Yearly) The slot durations are capped to 1 year and divided into 6-week periods(KSM- 12m/3m=4m); The slot durations are capped to 2 years and divided into 3-month periods (DOT- 24m/3m=8m);Once the parachain lease ends (48 weeks maximum on Kusama, 96 weeks on Polkadot), funds are returned to the contributors. Parachains may lease a slot for any combination of periods of the slot duration. Parachains may lease more than one slot over time, meaning that they could extend their lease to Polkadot past the maximum duration by leasing a contiguous slot. Note: Individual parachain slots are fungible. This means that parachains do not need to always inhabit the same slot, but as long as a parachain inhabits any slot it can continue as a parachain. You Can\u2019t (Technically) Combine Crowdloans and Private Bids Each period of the range 1 - 4 represents a 3-month duration for a total of 2 years. Bidders will submit a configuration of bids specifying the token amount they are willing to bond and for which periods. The slot ranges may be any of the periods 1 - n, where n is the number of periods available for a slot (n will be 8 for both Polkadot and Kusama). highest bidder for any given slot lease period might not always win (see the example below). There is one parachain slot available. Charlie bids 75 for the range 1 - 8. Dave bids 100 for the range 5 - 8. Emily bids 40 for the range 1 - 4. Let's calculate each bidder's valuation according to the algorithm. We do this by multiplying the bond amount by the number of periods in the specified range of the bid. Charlie - 75 * 8 = 600 for range 1 - 8 Dave - 100 * 4 = 400 for range 5 - 8 Emily - 40 * 4 = 160 for range 1 - 4 Although Dave had the highest bid in accordance to token amount, when we do the calculations we see that since he only bid for a range of 4, he would need to share the slot with Emily who bid much less. Together Dave's and Emily's bids only equals a valuation of 560. A random number, which is based on the VRF used by Polkadot, is determined at each block. Additionally, each auction will have a threshold that starts at 0 and increases to 1. The random number produced by the VRF is examined next to the threshold to determine if that block is the end of the auction within the so-called ending period. Charlie's valuation for the entire range is 600. Therefore Charlie is awarded the complete range of the parachain slot. While each parachain auction is scheduled for seven days, the candle auction format means that the \u201cend\u201d date and time is a bit of a wildcard. The first two days are confirmed to be an \u201copen\u201d period of the auction. The following five days, however, fall within the \u201cwick\u201d of this theoretical candle, and the auction will end sometime in this five-day period. so you won\u2019t actually know in real-time when the auction ends. project must specify the following information: Parachain ID/Index (which parachain the bid or crowdloan will support) First and Last Slot (the lease is broken into 8 increments, and projects can bid on a partial or full lease period) While these crowdloan bids occur, the private-bid projects (Turquoise/Salmon) don\u2019t have to enter additional bids. However, after Day 2, it becomes risky to wait since the auction can end at any time. Finally, on Day 4, Salmon Parachain enters a private bid of 5000 DOT and briefly takes the lead in the auction. Unfortunately, on Day 5, Salmon Parachain is quickly outbid by a private bid from Turquoise Parachain AND an increased bid from the Purple Parachain crowdloan module. These antics continue until Day 7 when the highest bid is Purple Parachain with 18,000 DOT. However, importantly, Purple does not win. The winner is Turquoise. Turquoise Parachain wins the slot and is now able to connect to the Kusama network. This will likely happen soon after the slot is won since the lease period begins immediately. After the end of a lease period (48 week periods on Kusama and 96 week lease periods on Polkadot), the slot will be available for renewal or for another project to occupy. The remaining parachains must continue to compete for a slot, assuming their crowdloan modules remain open and the private bidders have the interest in pursuing a slot again, rather than waiting for a less competitive auction. Unbonding takes 28 days on Polkadot and 7 on Kusama .

A few key points: WebAssembly defines an instruction set, intermediate source format (WAST) and a binary encoded format (WASM). WebAssembly has a few higher level features, such as the ability to import and execute outside methods defined via an interface. WASM \u00b6 Fast. WebAssembly achieves near native performance. Compared with the Java, Python or JavaScript runtimes, it can be 10x to 100x faster (how is this possible?). It is also much faster than Docker, especially in cold start and system access. Safe. WebAssembly is a sandbox with a capability-based security model. It is not only safer than native binaries, but also safer than OS-level containers like Docker. Yet it provides access to the underlying system, icnluding new hardware features. Portable.

This library, like libcore, normally doesn\u2019t need to be used directly since its contents are re-exported in the std crate. Crates that use the #![no_std] attribute however will typically not depend on std, so they\u2019d use this crate instead. https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/index.html Core \u00b6 The Rust Core Library The Rust Core Library is the dependency-free1 foundation of The Rust Standard Library. It is the portable glue between the language and its libraries, defining the intrinsic and primitive building blocks of all Rust code. It links to no upstream libraries, no system libraries, and no libc. The core library is minimal: it isn\u2019t even aware of heap allocation, nor does it provide concurrency or I/O. These things require platform integration, and this library is platform-agnostic. https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/index.html Crate proc_macroCopy \u00b6 A support library for macro authors when defining new macros. This library, provided by the standard distribution, provides the types consumed in the interfaces of procedurally defined macro definitions such as function-like macros #[proc_macro], macro attributes #[proc_macro_attribute] and custom derive attributes#[proc_macro_derive]. https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/index.html Std(The Rust Standard Library) \u00b6 The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the broader Rust ecosystem. It offers core types, like Vec and Option , library-defined operations on language primitives, standard macros, I/O and multithreading, among many other things. std is available to all Rust crates by default. Therefore, the standard library can be accessed in use statements through the path std, as in use std::env. https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html Test \u00b6 Support code for rustc\u2019s built in unit-test and micro-benchmarking framework. Almost all user code will only be interested in Bencher and black_box . All other interactions (such as writing tests and benchmarks themselves) should be done via the #[test] and #[bench] attributes. See the Testing Chapter of the book for more details. https://doc.rust-lang.org/test/index.html \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 Memory \u00b6 Rust programs have 3 memory regions where data is stored: data memory - For data that is fixed in size and static (i.e. always available through life of program). Consider the text in your program (e.g. \"Hello World!\"): This text's bytes are only ever read from one place and therefore can be stored in this region. Compilers make lots of optimizations with this kind of data, and they are generally considered very fast to use since locations are known and fixed. \u00b6 stack memory - For data that is declared as variables within a function. The location of this memory never changes for the duration of a function call; because of this compilers can optimize code so stack data is very fast to access. \u00b6 heap memory - For data that is created while the application is running. Data in this region may be added, moved, removed, resized, etc. Because of its dynamic nature it's generally considered slower to use, but it allows for much more creative usages of memory. When data is added to this region we call it an allocation . When data is removed from this section we call it a deallocation . \u00b6 Thread \u00b6 LifeTime \u00b6 @Static A static variable is a memory resource created at compile-time that exists through a program start to finish . They must have their types explicitly specified so special lifetime lasting the entire program execution. A static lifetime is a memory resource that lasts indefinitely to the end of a program. Note that by this definition some static lifetime resources can be created at runtime. Lifetime specifiers always start with a ' (e.g. 'a, 'b, 'c). Resources with static lifetimes have a special lifetime specifier 'static. 'static resources will never drop. If static lifetime resources contain references they must all be 'static (anything less would not live long enough). fn main() { let mut foo = Foo { x: 42 }; let x = &mut foo.x; *x = 13; // x is dropped here, allowing us to create a non-mutable reference let y = do_something(&foo); println!(\"{} {}\", y, foo.x); // y is dropped here // foo is dropped here } /* Standard Output 42 */ Memory detail: Modifying static variables is inherently dangerous because they are globally accessable to be read from by anyone introducing the possibility of a data race. static X: T = T(); Global variable with 'static lifetime, single memory location. T: 'static Same; does esp. not mean value t will live 'static, only that it could. Language Sugar: Rvalue Static Promotion Makes references to constants 'static, e.g., &42, &None, &mut []. Promote constexpr rvalues to values in static memory instead of stack slots, and expose those in the language by being able to directly create 'static references to them. This would allow code like let x: &'static u32 = &42 to work. static PI: f64 = 3.1415; fn main() { // static variables can also be scoped to a function static mut SECRET: &'static str = \"swordfish\"; // string literals have a 'static lifetime let msg: &'static str = \"Hello World!\"; let p: &'static f64 = &PI; println!(\"{} {}\", msg, p); // You can break some rules, but you must be explicit unsafe { // we can set SECRET to a string literal because it is also `static SECRET = \"abracadabra\"; println!(\"{}\", SECRET); } } /* Standard Output Hello World! 3.1415 abracadabra */ @Unsafe If you still had access to (via unsafe) they might still look like valid S, but any attempt to use them as valid S is undefined behavior. \u2193 https://cheats.rs/#unsafe-unsound-undefined-dark side of force Try to avoid \"unsafe {}\", often safer, faster solution without it. Exception: FFI. Arc \u00b6 @Safe Arc presents us with a couple of use statements that include threads and something called Arc. Arc represents a thread-safe reference-counting pointer, and Arc stands for Atomically Reference Counted. You may know of this idea from old iOS Objective-C code or something like that. // arc1.rs // Make this code compile by filling in a value for `shared_numbers` where the // TODO comment is and create an initial binding for `child_numbers` // somewhere. Try not to create any copies of the `numbers` Vec! // Execute `rustlings hint arc1` for hints :) use std::sync::Arc; use std::thread; fn main() { let numbers: Vec<_> = (0..100u32).collect(); let shared_numbers = Arc::new(numbers); let mut joinhandles = Vec::new(); for offset in 0..8 { let child_numbers = shared_numbers.clone(); joinhandles.push(thread::spawn(move || { let mut i = offset; let mut sum = 0; while i < child_numbers.len() { sum += child_numbers[i]; i += 5; } println!(\"Sum of offset {} is {}\", offset, sum); })); } for handle in joinhandles.into_iter() { handle.join().unwrap(); } } What Arc does is provides shared ownership of a value allocated in the heap. Invoking clone on Arc gives you a new Arc instance, which points to the same allocation on the heap as the original source Arc. What Arc will do is then increase the reference count, and it will not drop the value inside of the Arc until the last reference has dropped. In this code, what we need to do is set a value for shared_numbers and then also create an initial binding for child_numbers such that we can use the value inside of the multiple threads that are spawned for the range zero to eight. Note that numbers here is a Vec which we've told the Rust compiler to infer the type of with this <_>, and also told that the type by using a range of to 100 as u32. For shared_numbers, what we'll do is create a new Arc . Note that we also need to use new binding for child_numbers. We have a number of places we could put it, including right below shared_numbers or inside of this loop. We're going to do this inside of the loop so that we create a new clone and increase the Arc reference counter for every offset that we spawn a new thread for. Note that shared_numbers is a new Arc that contains the Vec for each offset in the range zero to eight, which we spawn a thread for child_numbers, clones shared_numbers, which increments the Arc counter and allows child_numbers to access the same data \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 \u270d\ufe0f\u270d\ufe0f\u270d\ufe0f Let's Start - to setup in 5min https://www.gitpod.io/docs/languages/rust#rust-in-gitpod Getting started with Toturial Introduction - Rust By Example Learn Rust - Rust Programming Language Tour of Rust - Let's go on an adventure!

Exception: FFI.","title":"LifeTime"},{"location":"public/blockchain/rust-lang/#arc","text":"@Safe Arc presents us with a couple of use statements that include threads and something called Arc. Arc represents a thread-safe reference-counting pointer, and Arc stands for Atomically Reference Counted. You may know of this idea from old iOS Objective-C code or something like that. // arc1.rs // Make this code compile by filling in a value for `shared_numbers` where the // TODO comment is and create an initial binding for `child_numbers` // somewhere. Try not to create any copies of the `numbers` Vec! // Execute `rustlings hint arc1` for hints :) use std::sync::Arc; use std::thread; fn main() { let numbers: Vec<_> = (0..100u32).collect(); let shared_numbers = Arc::new(numbers); let mut joinhandles = Vec::new(); for offset in 0..8 { let child_numbers = shared_numbers.clone(); joinhandles.push(thread::spawn(move || { let mut i = offset; let mut sum = 0; while i < child_numbers.len() { sum += child_numbers[i]; i += 5; } println!(\"Sum of offset {} is {}\", offset, sum); })); } for handle in joinhandles.into_iter() { handle.join().unwrap(); } } What Arc does is provides shared ownership of a value allocated in the heap. Invoking clone on Arc gives you a new Arc instance, which points to the same allocation on the heap as the original source Arc. What Arc will do is then increase the reference count, and it will not drop the value inside of the Arc until the last reference has dropped. In this code, what we need to do is set a value for shared_numbers and then also create an initial binding for child_numbers such that we can use the value inside of the multiple threads that are spawned for the range zero to eight. Note that numbers here is a Vec which we've told the Rust compiler to infer the type of with this <_>, and also told that the type by using a range of to 100 as u32. For shared_numbers, what we'll do is create a new Arc . Note that we also need to use new binding for child_numbers. We have a number of places we could put it, including right below shared_numbers or inside of this loop. We're going to do this inside of the loop so that we create a new clone and increase the Arc reference counter for every offset that we spawn a new thread for. Note that shared_numbers is a new Arc that contains the Vec for each offset in the range zero to eight, which we spawn a thread for child_numbers, clones shared_numbers, which increments the Arc counter and allows child_numbers to access the same data \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 \u270d\ufe0f\u270d\ufe0f\u270d\ufe0f Let's Start - to setup in 5min https://www.gitpod.io/docs/languages/rust#rust-in-gitpod Getting started with Toturial Introduction - Rust By Example Learn Rust - Rust Programming Language Tour of Rust - Let's go on an adventure!

Serverless \u00b6 @FaaS is one of the fastest growing areas of cloud computing. FaaS allows developers to focus on the code. Once the developer uploads the code, the FaaS takes care of deployment, service availability, and scalability. The developer only pays for resources the service uses, not reserved idle time. This approach, known as serverless computing, is the way to build inter-connected and microservice-based applications. The result are fast development turn around, easy deployment, high availability, infinite scalability, at low cost. However, traditional FaaS are based on microVM (eg Firecracker and gVisor) and application container (eg Docker) technologies. They are general computing platforms not optimized for software stacks. To boot an entire OS and then heavy-weight runtimes just to run a single function is very inefficient. Therefore, existing FaaS solutions suffer from issues such as slow cold start, slow runtime performance, bloated runtime, and time-based billing. They are not suitable for computationally intensive applications. High-level language VMs, such as WebAssembly , offer a combination of ease-of-use, runtime safety, and high performance. The WasmEdge Runtime is a WebAssembly VM that is designed for edge cloud and device applications. It is a great fit for computationally intensive FaaS applications such as edge AI, real-time data analytics, multimedia processing, as well as typical transactional functions that need to start in sub-millisecond and make a quick call to another web service. \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 UsedFeatures \u00b6 @WasmEdge WasmEdge is a lightweight, high-performance, and extensible WebAssembly runtime for cloud native, edge, and decentralized applications.

Polkadot parachains can be built and maintained without ever touching Substrate. Substrate-based chains can exist as \u2018solo-chains\u2019 on an independent basis. Substrate is a fully modular blockchain framework that unleashes developers instead of forcing them to work within the confines of others' design decisions. Building a custom blockchain with Substrate offers greater freedom, flexibility, and optimization than building on top of a general-purpose smart-contract blockchain. you're not only free to choose your parameters such gas costs, governance, and consensus, you're also free to choose how your blockchain is deployed and if/how it should communicate with other networks. On my opinion for substrate future(DNA Replication) limitations-Resolved \u00b6 For example, reusing the Ethereum codebase implies several limitations: having to place all of your business logic in terms of the EVM , being forced to use one of the two EVM languages , having all business logic dynamically metered, and being limited to Ethereum's transaction pool and lack of core upgradability. Without Substrate, there would be no easy way to build the blockchains that constitute the Polkadot ecosystem, and many builders would be forced into using a constrictive and uniform smart contract environment, limiting innovation and leaving Polkadot\u2019s remarkable heterogeneous sharding system unutilized. MainModules \u00b6 Frame \u00b6 business logic is provided through a modular system known as FRAME . is a set of modules and support libraries that simplify runtime development. In Substrate, these modules are called Pallets , each hosting domain-specific logic to include in a chain's runtime. FRAME also provides some helper modules to interact with important Substrate Primitives that provide the interface to the core client. FRAME not only provides a library of commonly used Substrate pallets but also a framework to build custom domain-specific pallets, giving runtime engineers the flexibility to define their runtime's behavior according to their target use case. The result is each pallet has its own discrete logic which can modify the features and functionality of your blockchain's state transition functions. For example, the Balances pallet, which is included in FRAME, defines cryptocurrency capabilities for your blockchain. More specifically, it defines: Storage items that keep track of the tokens a user owns. Functions that users can call to transfer and manage those tokens. APIs which allow other pallets to make use of those tokens and their capabilities. Hooks which allow other pallets to trigger function calls when a user's balance changes. A FRAME pallet is composed of 7 sections: Imports and Dependencies Declaration of the Pallet type Runtime Configuration Trait Runtime Storage Runtime Events Hooks Extrinsics An example is as follows: https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/frame/ Pallets can be composed of as many sections as needed, giving runtime engineers a lot of flexibility on top of the basic skeletons depicted above. Refer to the Substrate Runtime Macros to learn more about adding functionality to a FRAME pallet. @System crate The FRAME System crate frame_system provides low-level types, storage, and functions for your blockchain. All other pallets depend on the System crate as the basis of your Substrate runtime. The System crate defines all the core types for the Substrate runtime , such as: Origin Block Number Account Id Hash Header Version etc... It also has a number of system-critical storage items, such as: Account Nonce Block Hash Block Number Events etc... Finally, it defines a number of low level functions which can access your blockchain storage, verify the origin of an extrinsic, and more. @Support crate@System crate The FRAME Support Crate frame_support is a collection of Rust macros, types, traits, and modules that simplify the development of Substrate pallets. The support macros expanded at compile time generate boilerplate code needed for the common structure of a pallet and save developers from writing them repeatedly. @Executive pallet@System crate The FRAME Executive Pallet frame_executive acts as the orchestration layer for the runtime. It dispatches incoming extrinsic calls to the respective pallets in the runtime. @Runtime@System crate The runtime library brings together all these components and pallets. It defines which pallets are included with your runtime and configures them to work together to compose your final runtime. When calls are made to your runtime, it uses the Executive pallet to dispatch those calls to the individual pallets. Pallet \u00b6 A developer may choose to have a pallet that enables smart contracts , or specifically not include pallets to keep their blockchain network lean and reduce attack vectors. For example, a developer may want to enable users to gain access to accounts even if they lose their private keys or other authentication mechanism. In this case, the developer would simply include the Recovery pallet. From the Oracle pallet to the Zero-Knowledge Verifier pallet and the Governance pallet, there are numerous existing pallets that can be integrated from the start or added later with forkless runtime upgrades. Developers can choose and even hot-swap components (pallets) such as the network stack, consensus, even the finality engine. Simply select from the growing list of pallets or create your own. When building with FRAME, the Substrate runtime is composed of several smaller components called pallets. A pallet contains a set of types, storage items, and functions that define a set of features and functionality for a runtime. @Prebuilt pallets https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/frame/ Atomic Swap, Aura, Authority Discovery, Authorship, BABE , Balances, Benchmark, Collective, Contracts, Democracy, Elections Phragm\u00e9n, Elections, GRANDPA, Identity, I'm Online, Indices, Membership, Multisig, Nicks, Offences, Proxy, Recovery, Randomness Collective Flip, Scheduler, Scored Pool, Session, Society, Staking, Sudo, Timestamp, Transaction Payment, Treasury, Utility, Vesting Execution environment \u00b6 Off-chain features run in their own Wasm execution environment outside of the Substrate runtime. Conceptes \u00b6 Extrinsics \u00b6 An extrinsic is a piece of information that comes from outside the chain and is included in a block. Extrinsics fall into three categories: inherents, signed transactions, and unsigned transactions. Note that events are not extrinsics. The chain emits events for pieces of information that are intrinsic to the chain itself. For example, staking rewards are events, not extrinsics, because the reward is triggered by circumstances intrinsic to the chain's logic . The header contains a block height, parent hash, extrinsics root, state root, and digest. @Inherents Inherents are pieces of information that are not signed and only inserted into a block by the block author . They are not gossiped on the network or stored in the transaction queue. For example, the author of the block may insert a timestamp inherent into the block. There is no way to prove that a timestamp is true the way the desire to send funds is proved with a signature. Rather, validators accept or reject the block based on how reasonable the other validators find the timestamp, which may mean it is within some acceptable range of their own system clocks. @SignedTransactions Contain a signature of the account that issued the transaction and stands to pay a fee to have the transaction included on chain. Because the value of including signed transactions on-chain can be recognized prior to execution, they can be gossiped on the network between nodes with a low risk of spam. @UnsignedTransactions Since the transaction is not signed, there is nobody to pay a fee . Because of this, the transaction queue lacks economic logic to prevent spam. Unsigned transactions also lack a nonce, making replay protection difficult . A few transactions warrant using the unsigned variant, but they will require some form of spam prevention based on a custom implementation of signed extension, which can exist on unsigned transactions. An example of unsigned transactions in Substrate is the I'm Online heartbeat transaction sent by authorities . The transaction includes a signature from a Session key, which does not control funds and therefore cannot pay a fee. The transaction pool controls spam by checking if a heartbeat has already been submitted in the session. \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 Features \u00b6 Configurable \u00b6 @Feeless Unlike many legacy blockchain networks, which have hard limits for transaction throughput, Substrate is configurable. Transaction latency can be alleviated through configurable blocktimes, flexible transaction queues, and/or horizontal scaling. Transaction fees are configurable even to the point of feeless transactions. Development is faster since developers can use the tooling they prefer and select from a growing list of pallets instead of building from scratch. Upgrades happen faster thanks to forkless runtime upgrades. Light-client-first \u00b6 Another unique attribute of Substrate is its \u201clight-client-first\u201d design which can run directly in-browser and interact with a chain in a fully trustless way. Traditional approaches for syncing nodes require users to run dedicated hardware and wait a long time for their node to sync, or as a workaround, use a centralized service provider. Substrate light-clients sync lightning fast and drastically increase the decentralization of blockchain networks. Developers can relax, knowing their end users aren\u2019t reliant on a separate node infrastructure susceptible to downtime or hacking. Security \u00b6 Substrate chains can inherit security from Substrate-based relay chains like Polkadot or Kusama. Offchain \u00b6 Off-chain features run in their own execution environment outside of the Substrate runtime . This creates a separation of concerns and ensures block production is not impacted by long-running off-chain tasks. Although the primary benefit of off-chain features may be cost, there are many other benefits. For example, off-chain features can enable private data to be easily stored and retrievable off-chain to support record deletion and other needs of GDPR-compliant use cases and applications. Off-Chain Worker subsystems allows execution of long-running and possibly non-deterministic tasks (e.g. web requests, encryption/decryption and signing of data, random number generation, CPU-intensive computations, enumeration/aggregation of on-chain data, etc.) that could otherwise require longer than the block execution time. Off-chain workers have access to extended APIs for communicating with the external world: Ability to submit transactions (either signed or unsigned) to the chain to publish computation results. A fully-featured HTTP client allowing the worker to access and fetch data from external services. Access to the local keystore to sign and verify statements or transactions. An additional, local key-value database shared between all off-chain workers. A secure, local entropy source for random number generation. Access to the node's precise local time. The ability to sleep and resume work. Note that the results from off-chain workers are not subject to regular transaction verification. A verification mechanism should be implemented to determine what information gets into the chain. Off-Chain Storage offers storage that is local to a Substrate node that can be accessed both by off-chain workers (both read and write access) and on-chain logic (write access via off-chain indexing but not read access). This allows different worker threads to communicate to each other and to store user or node-specific data that does not require consensus over the whole network. It can also be read using RPC. Off-Chain Indexing allows the runtime, if opted-in, to write directly to the off-chain storage independently from OCWs. This serves as a local/temporary storage for on-chain logic and complement to its on-chain state. Nodes have to opt-in for persistency of this data via --enable-offchain-indexing flag when starting up the Substrate node. Unlike OCWs, which are not executed during initial blockchain synchronization, off-chain indexing is populating the storage every time a block is processed, so the data is always consistent and will be exactly the same for every node with indexing enabled. \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 Compatibility \u00b6 SRML \u00b6 SRML provides the basic building blocks for Substrate-based blockchains and includes all the essential functionality for a purpose-built blockchain. Among the various modules included with the SRML is the Contracts module, designed for executing \"native\" Wasm smart contracts on any Substrate-based chain. @Parity Moreover, Parity Technologies is a long-term supporter and builder in the Ethereum ecosystem, and we want to continue to provide support and infrastructure as we can to teams who have built on the Parity platform as we move from \u201cBlockchain 2.0\u201d to \u201c3.0\u201d. As part of this ongoing support, and to ensure that Substrate and Polkadot remain as inclusive as possible to the broader DApp community, we\u2019ve (Parity Team)built an EVM implementation for the SRML. Substrate EVM is an SRML module that provides an EVM execution environment for running unmodified Solidity code \u201cnatively\u201d on a Substrate-based blockchain. In essence, Substrate EVM will allow Substrate-based blockchains, including Polkadot parachains, to host a nearly-complete instance of the Ethereum state transition function on-chain, alongside any additional Substrate modules as required for custom functionality. Existing Solidity applications can be deployed and executed in this environment, and will gain the added benefits of being part of a Substrate-based blockchain. These benefits include the possibility of integration with other Substrate modules and of connecting to the broader Polkadot network, thereby enabling interoperability not only with other Polkadot parachains but, via bridges, with external blockchains as well, including Ethereum mainnet. Interoperability with other Substrate modules is possible thanks to custom-built \"pre-compiled contract\" APIs, which will allow all basic SRML functionality, including calls between modules, balance transfers, and interchain messaging. Differences between the Substrate EVM module and the Ethereum mainnet EVM include block hashes, which are fetched via the System module. In addition, the underlying EVM engine ( SputnikVM ) has been modified to make it modular, which will allow us to enable users to swap out and customize individual components (such as the gasometer) to their applications' specific needs.

FRAME also provides some helper modules to interact with important Substrate Primitives that provide the interface to the core client. FRAME not only provides a library of commonly used Substrate pallets but also a framework to build custom domain-specific pallets, giving runtime engineers the flexibility to define their runtime's behavior according to their target use case. The result is each pallet has its own discrete logic which can modify the features and functionality of your blockchain's state transition functions. For example, the Balances pallet, which is included in FRAME, defines cryptocurrency capabilities for your blockchain. More specifically, it defines: Storage items that keep track of the tokens a user owns. Functions that users can call to transfer and manage those tokens. APIs which allow other pallets to make use of those tokens and their capabilities. Hooks which allow other pallets to trigger function calls when a user's balance changes. A FRAME pallet is composed of 7 sections: Imports and Dependencies Declaration of the Pallet type Runtime Configuration Trait Runtime Storage Runtime Events Hooks Extrinsics An example is as follows: https://docs.substrate.io/v3/runtime/frame/ Pallets can be composed of as many sections as needed, giving runtime engineers a lot of flexibility on top of the basic skeletons depicted above.

Extrinsics fall into three categories: inherents, signed transactions, and unsigned transactions. Note that events are not extrinsics. The chain emits events for pieces of information that are intrinsic to the chain itself. For example, staking rewards are events, not extrinsics, because the reward is triggered by circumstances intrinsic to the chain's logic . The header contains a block height, parent hash, extrinsics root, state root, and digest. @Inherents Inherents are pieces of information that are not signed and only inserted into a block by the block author . They are not gossiped on the network or stored in the transaction queue. For example, the author of the block may insert a timestamp inherent into the block. There is no way to prove that a timestamp is true the way the desire to send funds is proved with a signature. Rather, validators accept or reject the block based on how reasonable the other validators find the timestamp, which may mean it is within some acceptable range of their own system clocks. @SignedTransactions Contain a signature of the account that issued the transaction and stands to pay a fee to have the transaction included on chain. Because the value of including signed transactions on-chain can be recognized prior to execution, they can be gossiped on the network between nodes with a low risk of spam. @UnsignedTransactions Since the transaction is not signed, there is nobody to pay a fee . Because of this, the transaction queue lacks economic logic to prevent spam. Unsigned transactions also lack a nonce, making replay protection difficult . A few transactions warrant using the unsigned variant, but they will require some form of spam prevention based on a custom implementation of signed extension, which can exist on unsigned transactions. An example of unsigned transactions in Substrate is the I'm Online heartbeat transaction sent by authorities . The transaction includes a signature from a Session key, which does not control funds and therefore cannot pay a fee. The transaction pool controls spam by checking if a heartbeat has already been submitted in the session. \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46","title":"Extrinsics"},{"location":"public/blockchain/substrate-framework/#features","text":"","title":"Features"},{"location":"public/blockchain/substrate-framework/#configurable","text":"@Feeless Unlike many legacy blockchain networks, which have hard limits for transaction throughput, Substrate is configurable.

These chains connect to and are secured by the Polkadot Relay Chain. They can also connect with external networks via bridges. Inbound-outboundTransaction \u00b6 @Ingress Dynamic information includes aspects of the transaction routing system that must have global agreement such as the parachain\u2019s ingress queue @Egress ... \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 Parachain \u00b6 A first parachain implementation, likely to be based heavily on an existing blockchain protocol such as Bitcoin or (more likely, since it provides for rich transactions) Ethereum. This will include an integration with the proof-of-stake chain, allowing the parachain to gain consensus without its own internal consensus mechanism. Each parachain is defined in this registry. It is a relatively simple database-like construct and holds both static and dynamic information on each chain.Static information includes the chain index (a simple integer), along with the validation protocol identity. Each parachain brings with it the potential to grief validators with an over-burdensome validation algorithm. @zk-SNARKs A parachain utilising the properties of zk-SNARKs in order to ensure identities of transactors on it are kept private. A stretch goal dependent on the relay-chain. Relay-chains \u00b6 This is the final stage of the relay-chain, allowing the dynamic addition, removal and emergency pausing of parachains, the reporting of bad behaviour and includes implementation of the \\fisherman\" functionality Polkadot will be able to scale even further in the future with a planned feature known as nested relay chains, which will increase the number of shards that can be added to the network. Interchain \u00b6 (according to the logic of that chain) able to effect the dispatch of a transaction into a second parachain or, potentially , the relay-chain. Like external transactions on production blockchains, they are fully asynchronous and there is no intrinsic ability for them to return any kind of information back to its origin. @MessageProtocol The secret sauce of parachain interoperability lies in XCMP. XCMP enables parachains to share trusted logic, for example, transferring tokens between networks, without any additional trust assumptions! XCM is related to cross-chain in the same way that REST is related RESTful. XCM cannot actually send messages between systems. It is a format for how message transfer should be performed, similar to how RESTful services use REST as an architectural style of deployment. @Queue Interchain transactions are resolved using a simple queuing mechanism based around a Merkle tree to ensure fidelity. @Routing Posts Routing. Each parachain header includes an egress-trie-root; These posts are structured as several FIFO queues; the number of lists is known as the routing base and may be around 16. Notably, this number represents the quantity of parachains we can support without having to resort to multi-phase routing. Initially, Polkadot will support this kind of direct routing. Hyper-cube Routing. Hyper-cube routing is a mechanism which can mostly be build as an extension to the basic routing mechanism described above. Validators \u00b6 Validators may provide only a \\null\" block containing no external \"transactions\" data, but may run the risk of getting a reduced reward if they do. List of punishable validator misbehaviour includes: \u2022 Being part of a parachain group unable to provide consensus over the validity of a parachain block. \u2022 Actively signing for the validity of an invalid parachain block. \u2022 Inability to supply egress payloads previously voted as available. \u2022 Inactivity during the consensus process. \u2022 Validating relay-chain blocks on competing forks. Parachain validators will need to collect additional input data from the previous set of validators or the availability guarantors. Each participant (validator) has a set of information, in the form of signed-statements (\"votes\") from other participants, regarding each parachain block candidate as well the relaychain block candidate. The set of information is two pieces: Availability: does this validator have egress transaction-post information from this block so they are able to properly validate parachain candidates on the following block? They may vote either 1(known) or 0 (not yet known). Validity: is the parachain block valid and is all externally-referenced data (e.g. transactions). They may vote either 1 (valid), -1 (invalid) or 0 (not yet known). The basic rules for validity of the individual blocks (that allow the total set of validators as a whole to come to consensus on it becoming the unique parachain candidate to be referenced from the canonical relay): \u2022 must have at least two thirds of its validators voting positively and none voting negatively; \u2022 must have over one third validators voting positively to the availability of egress queue information. @BFT All validators must submit votes; votes may be resubmitted, qualified by the rules above. The progression of consensus may be modelled as multiple standard BFT consensus algorithms over each parachain happening in parallel. @Bonded-Validator It allows an account to register a desire to become a bonded validator (along with its requirements), to nominate to some identity, and for preexisting bonded validators to register their desire to exit this status. @Sealing Under a PoW chain,sealing is effectively a synonym for mining. In our case, it involves the collection of signed statements from validators over the validity, availability and canonicality of a particular relay-chain block and the parachain blocks that it represents. The relay-chain block may then be sealed and the process of sealing the next block begun. The sealing process takes place under a single consensus-generating mechanism addressing both the relay-chain\u2019s block and the parachains\u2019 blocks. @Improvments-for-sealing-relay-blocks Public Participation . One more possible direction is to enlist public participation in the process through a micro-complaints system. Similar to the fishermen, there could be external parties to police the validators who claim availability. Their task is to find one who appears unable to demonstrate such availability. Availability Guarantors . A (this may be represented by Validators in the basic form of the protocol). Availability guarantors will mostly aim to maintain a stable connection to each other and to validators. A final route would be to nominate a second set of bonded validators as \"availability guarantors\". Unlike normal validators, they would not switch between parachains but rather would form a single group to attest to the availability of all important interchain data. This has the advantage of relaxing the equivalence between participants and chains. Overweight Blocks. If a validator set is compromised, they may create and propose a block which though valid, takes an inordinate amount of time to execute and validate. This is a problem since a validator group could reasonably form a block which takes a very long time to execute unless some particular piece of information is already known allowing a short cut, e.g. factoring a large prime. If a single collator knew that information, then they would have a clear advantage in getting their own candidates accepted as long as the others were busy processing the old block. We call these blocks overweight. To ensure validators can predict when they may be proposing an overweight block, it may be sensible to require them to publish information on their own performance for each block. Collator Insurance. One issue remains for validators: unlike with PoW networks, to check a collator\u2019s block for validity, they must actually execute the transactions in it. Malicious collators can feed invalid or overweight blocks to validators causing them grief and exacting a potentially substantial opportunity cost. To mitigate this, we propose a simple strategy on the part of validators. Firstly, parachain block candidates sent to validators must be signed from a relay chain account with funds; if they are not, then the validator should drop it immediately. Collator Preferences. One important aspect of this system is to ensure that there is a healthy selection of collators creating the blocks in any given parachain. If a single collator dominated a parachain then some attacks become more feasible. Collators \u00b6 it is quite possible that this mechanism enables even very small stakeholders to contribute as a collator. This is the delivery of an alternative chain-specific collator functionality. It includes proof creation (for collators), parachain misbehaviour detection (for fishermen) and the validation function (for validators). It also includes any additional networking required to allow the two to discover and communicate. @zero-knowledge@gossip Validators work alongside a parachain gossip protocol with collators individuals who collate transactions into blocks and provide a noninteractive, zero-knowledge proof that the block constitutes a valid child of its parent (and taking any transaction fees for their trouble Fishermen \u00b6 The parties get a reward for reporting such activity; their term, \"fishermen\" stems from the unlikeliness of such a reward. Fishermen, as well as general relay-chain and parachain clients will generally aim to keep a connection open to a validator or guarantor. Queue \u00b6 These queues are administered on the relay-chain allowing parachains to determine each other\u2019s saturation status; this way a failed attempt to post a transaction to a stalled destination may be reported synchronously. (Though since no return path exists, if a secondary transaction failed for that reason.) Networking \u00b6 @overlay@devp2p @p2p solved around a few request and answer message types. While Ethereum made progress on current protocol offerings with the devp2p protocol, which allowed for many subprotocols to be multiplexed over a single peer connection and thus have the same peer overlay support many p2p protocols simultaneously.To ensure an efficient transport mechanism, a \"flat\" overlay network like Ethereum\u2019s devp2p. Polkadot are rather more substantial. Rather then a wholly uniform network, Polkadot has several types of participants each with different requirements over their peer makeup and several network \"avenues\" whose participants will tend to converse about particular data. This means a substantially more structured network overlay|and a protocol supporting that will likely be necessary. network participants into two sets (relay-chain, parachains) each of three subsets. Path to an Effective Network Protocol. Likely the most effective and reasonable development effort will focus on utilising a pre-existing protocol rather than rolling our own. Several peer-to-peer base protocols exist that we may use or augment including Ethereum\u2019s own devp2p, IPFS\u2019s libp2p and GNU\u2019s GNUnet. A full review of these protocols and their relevance for building a modular peer network supporting certain structural guarantees, dynamic peer steering and extensible sub-protocols is well beyond the scope of this document. \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 Parachain-Block \u00b6 @Candidate Such subsets of validators are required to provide a parachain block candidate which is guaranteed valid (on pain of bond confiscation). Transaction-forwarding-contract \u00b6 In short, we envision that transactions from Polkadot can be signed by validators and then fed into Ethereum where they can be interpreted and enacted by a transaction-forwarding contract. Break-in-contract \u00b6 Ethereum is able to host a \"break-in contract\" which can maintain the 144 signatories and be controlled by them. we can imagine a \"break-in\" contract within a parachain which allows a validator to be guaranteed payment in exchange for the provision of a particular volume of processing resources. These resources may be measured in something like gas, but could also be some entirely novel model such as subjective time-to-execute or a Bitcoin-like flat-fee model. Breakout-contract \u00b6 @Header we can imagine our Polkadot-side Ethereum interface to have some simple functions: to be able to accept a new header from the Ethereum network and validate the PoW, to be able to accept some proof that a particular log was emitted by the Ethereum-side breakout contract for a header of sufficient depth (and forward the corresponding message within Polkadot) and finally to be able to accept proofs that a previously accepted but not-yet-enacted header contains an invalid receipt root. Delivering a transaction from Bitcoin to Polkadot can in principle be done with a process similar to that for Ethereum; a \\break-out address\" controlled in some way by the Polkadot validators could receive transferred tokens (and data sent alongside them). Any tokens then owned in the \"break-out address\" would then, in principle, be controlled by those same validators for later dispersal Staking-Contract \u00b6 This contract maintains the validator set. It manages: \u2022 which accounts are currently validators; \u2022 which are available to become validators at short notice; \u2022 which accounts have placed stake nominating to a validator; \u2022 properties of each including staking volume, acceptable payout-rates and addresses and short term (session) identities. \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46 POS \u00b6 Proof-of-stake chain: Extending the consensus mechanism into proof-of stake territory; this module includes staking tokens, managing entry and exit from the validator pool, a market mechanism for determining validator rewards, finalising the approval-voting nomination mechanism and managing bond-confiscation and dismissal.

NPOS \u00b6 @Stake-Token-Liquidity Keeping with our tenets, we elect for the simplest solution: not all tokens be staked .

Unlike common current systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, interchain transactions do not come with any kind of payment\" of fee associated ; any such payment must be managed through negotiation logic on the source and destination parachains. Calling into another such chain would mean proxying through this bridge, which would provide the means of negotiating the value transfer between chains in order to pay for the computation resources required on the destination parachain. Gas \u00b6 cost of Ethereum confirming that an instruction was properly validated as coming from the Polkadot network would be no more than 300,000 gas|a mere 6% of the total block gas limit at 5.5M. then the cost to the network of maintaining this Ethereum-forwarding bridge would be around 540,000 gas per day or, at present gas prices, $45 per year. without gas, how does one parachain avoid another parachain from forcing it to do computation? While we can rely on transaction-post ingress queue buffers to prevent one chain from spamming another with transaction data, there is no equivalent mechanism provided by the protocol to prevent the spamming of transaction processing. Because of Substrate\u2019s modularity, gas is completely optional, and the introduction of off-chain features greatly reduces computation and storage costs. \u270d\ufe0f\u270d\ufe0f\u270d\ufe0f Signature \u00b6 One interesting, and cheaper, alternative to this multisignature contract model would be to use \u270d\ufe0fthreshold signatures in order to achieve the multi-lateral ownership semantics .

Frequently Asked Questions Is Polkadot designed to replace (insert blockchain here)? No. The goal of Polkadot is to provide a framework under which new blockchains may be created and to which existing blockchains can, if their communities desire, be transitioned. Is Polkadot designed to replace (insert crypto-currency here)? No. Polkadot tokens are neither intended nor designed to be used as a currency. They would make a bad currency: most will remain illiquid in the staking system and those that are liquid will face substantial fees for transfer of ownership. Rather, the purpose of Polkadot tokens is to be a direct representation of stake in the Polkadot network. What is the inflation rate for Polkadot staking tokens? The Polkadot staking token base expansion is unlimited. It rises and lowers according to market effects in order to target a particular proportion of tokens held under long-term bond in the validation process. Why does staking token ownership reflect stakeholding? This is a mechanism realised by the fact that they underpin the network\u2019s security. As such their value is tied to the overall economic value that Polkadot provides. Any actors who gain overall value from Polkadot operating correctly are incentivised to ensure it continues to do so. The best means of doing so is to take part in the validation process. This generally implies ownership of staking tokens. \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcda Literature \u00b6 external data referenced = transactions grief = wasting their resources a posted transaction = post XCMP = Cross-Chain Message Passing runtime = state transition function https://docs.substrate.io/v3/getting-started/glossary/ \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f If you liked this article or if it helped you please clap on this post to help the Read.Cash algorithm recommend it to more people.

Like external transactions on production blockchains, they are fully asynchronous and there is no intrinsic ability for them to return any kind of information back to its origin. @MessageProtocol The secret sauce of parachain interoperability lies in XCMP. XCMP enables parachains to share trusted logic, for example, transferring tokens between networks, without any additional trust assumptions! XCM is related to cross-chain in the same way that REST is related RESTful. XCM cannot actually send messages between systems. It is a format for how message transfer should be performed, similar to how RESTful services use REST as an architectural style of deployment. @Queue Interchain transactions are resolved using a simple queuing mechanism based around a Merkle tree to ensure fidelity. @Routing Posts Routing. Each parachain header includes an egress-trie-root; These posts are structured as several FIFO queues; the number of lists is known as the routing base and may be around 16. Notably, this number represents the quantity of parachains we can support without having to resort to multi-phase routing. Initially, Polkadot will support this kind of direct routing. Hyper-cube Routing. Hyper-cube routing is a mechanism which can mostly be build as an extension to the basic routing mechanism described above.","title":"Interchain"},{"location":"public/blockchain/whitepaper/#validators","text":"Validators may provide only a \\null\" block containing no external \"transactions\" data, but may run the risk of getting a reduced reward if they do. List of punishable validator misbehaviour includes: \u2022 Being part of a parachain group unable to provide consensus over the validity of a parachain block. \u2022 Actively signing for the validity of an invalid parachain block. \u2022 Inability to supply egress payloads previously voted as available. \u2022 Inactivity during the consensus process. \u2022 Validating relay-chain blocks on competing forks. Parachain validators will need to collect additional input data from the previous set of validators or the availability guarantors. Each participant (validator) has a set of information, in the form of signed-statements (\"votes\") from other participants, regarding each parachain block candidate as well the relaychain block candidate. The set of information is two pieces: Availability: does this validator have egress transaction-post information from this block so they are able to properly validate parachain candidates on the following block? They may vote either 1(known) or 0 (not yet known). Validity: is the parachain block valid and is all externally-referenced data (e.g. transactions). They may vote either 1 (valid), -1 (invalid) or 0 (not yet known). The basic rules for validity of the individual blocks (that allow the total set of validators as a whole to come to consensus on it becoming the unique parachain candidate to be referenced from the canonical relay): \u2022 must have at least two thirds of its validators voting positively and none voting negatively; \u2022 must have over one third validators voting positively to the availability of egress queue information. @BFT All validators must submit votes; votes may be resubmitted, qualified by the rules above. The progression of consensus may be modelled as multiple standard BFT consensus algorithms over each parachain happening in parallel. @Bonded-Validator It allows an account to register a desire to become a bonded validator (along with its requirements), to nominate to some identity, and for preexisting bonded validators to register their desire to exit this status. @Sealing Under a PoW chain,sealing is effectively a synonym for mining. In our case, it involves the collection of signed statements from validators over the validity, availability and canonicality of a particular relay-chain block and the parachain blocks that it represents. The relay-chain block may then be sealed and the process of sealing the next block begun. The sealing process takes place under a single consensus-generating mechanism addressing both the relay-chain\u2019s block and the parachains\u2019 blocks. @Improvments-for-sealing-relay-blocks Public Participation . One more possible direction is to enlist public participation in the process through a micro-complaints system. Similar to the fishermen, there could be external parties to police the validators who claim availability. Their task is to find one who appears unable to demonstrate such availability. Availability Guarantors . A (this may be represented by Validators in the basic form of the protocol). Availability guarantors will mostly aim to maintain a stable connection to each other and to validators. A final route would be to nominate a second set of bonded validators as \"availability guarantors\". Unlike normal validators, they would not switch between parachains but rather would form a single group to attest to the availability of all important interchain data. This has the advantage of relaxing the equivalence between participants and chains. Overweight Blocks. If a validator set is compromised, they may create and propose a block which though valid, takes an inordinate amount of time to execute and validate. This is a problem since a validator group could reasonably form a block which takes a very long time to execute unless some particular piece of information is already known allowing a short cut, e.g. factoring a large prime. If a single collator knew that information, then they would have a clear advantage in getting their own candidates accepted as long as the others were busy processing the old block. We call these blocks overweight. To ensure validators can predict when they may be proposing an overweight block, it may be sensible to require them to publish information on their own performance for each block. Collator Insurance. One issue remains for validators: unlike with PoW networks, to check a collator\u2019s block for validity, they must actually execute the transactions in it. Malicious collators can feed invalid or overweight blocks to validators causing them grief and exacting a potentially substantial opportunity cost. To mitigate this, we propose a simple strategy on the part of validators. Firstly, parachain block candidates sent to validators must be signed from a relay chain account with funds; if they are not, then the validator should drop it immediately. Collator Preferences. One important aspect of this system is to ensure that there is a healthy selection of collators creating the blocks in any given parachain. If a single collator dominated a parachain then some attacks become more feasible.","title":"Validators"},{"location":"public/blockchain/whitepaper/#collators","text":"it is quite possible that this mechanism enables even very small stakeholders to contribute as a collator.

I keep thinking 2021 and 2020 were actually the same year due to the pandemic. 2020 was a wild year because I joined Facebook/Meta, moved the entire family to Seattle, moved back to Arizona, left Facebook/Meta, bought a house and started at Coder. Even writing that last sentence feels tiring. There was a lot happening. But fast-forward to 2021 and it was actually a wonderful year. Working Full-Time on Open Source for Coder I joined Coder in December 2020 as an Open Source TypeScript Engineer. My responsibility was and still is to maintain an open source project called code-server, which is VS Code in the browser. I feel very grateful to have this job and work on open source every day. My work is all public on GitHub and anyone can go see it. And I get to interact with the community on a regular basis. Sometimes people help us debug issues. Other times they raise PRs and fix issues for us. It\u2019s amazing! And I\u2019ve really been enjoying my time at Coder. It\u2019s one of the first places where I look forward to going to work and I\u2019m learning new things everyday. I would say I looked forward to work 90% of the year. Yes, I had bad days. But I also have many many days where I am thinking about work on the weekend because I\u2019m so excited about this space. DevTools, specifically IDEs, is an exciting space. I do genuinely believe remote development is the future and I\u2019m happy I get to contribute to it. Becoming a Dad The other amazing part of the year was becoming a dad! In October, our first daughter (and first kid) was born. I really didn\u2019t know what to expect becoming a parent, but now I\u2019m starting to understand what it means. The biggest realization is how much attention I paid to things that don\u2019t matter before she was born. Now, I realize all I want is to take care of my family (wife, daughter and two dogs) and have a job that I enjoy. That\u2019s basically it. Everything else is icing on the cake. I also have a ton of respect for single parents. How do you do it?! I could never. It takes a village to raise a child. Thankfully we have lots of family here in Arizona to help us. 2021 Highlights Here are some of my other highlights for the year: attempted my first SaaS started livestreaming on Twitch 3,174 GitHub Contributions $36,942.02 in side income revenue 119 hours in the gym, 208 workouts, 1,774,602lbs lifted Goals for 2022 I try to practice systems over goals but I have 3 main things I\u2019m focusing on for 2022. Be the Best Dad and Husband I feel very fortunate that we had our first baby in 2021. Now I want to do everything I can to be the best dad for her and the best husband for my wife. I will be mindful when I\u2019m with them. Protect them, love them and take care of them. One of this biggest things I\u2019d like to do is generate wealth so they have long-term financial support. Since I\u2019m the breadwinner in the family, I\u2019d like to earn and save enough so that if something terrible happens, money isn\u2019t an issue for them. Launch TS Course I launched my first course - Vim for VSCode - in 2020. I started working on a TypeScript course in 2021. In 2022, I will partner with egghead and launch the TypeScript course. The goal is to have industry-level impact akin to Testing JavaScript or Epic React. Double Side-Project Income (> $50k) I\u2019d like to double my side-project income. On the low-end, it should be over $50k. To actually double it though, it should be closer to $75k. I plan to do this through my courses (Vim & TypeScript) and job board & job referrals. We\u2019ll see. It feels like I\u2019m shooting for the moon, but it can\u2019t hurt to try. Conclusion That\u2019s all! Thanks for reading.

Since then, others have asked how they can do the same. The outcome is a result of using something that I like to call the Fast Framework. This guide will teach you how you can use it to learn anything quickly. Imagine you\u2019re in racing a car. Your goal is to cross the finish line. Taking this analogy, we break the framework into three phases: Make your Map Stay on Track Cross the Finishline In each phase, I\u2019ll cover different aspects that will help you learn fast and reach your goal. I\u2019ll use learning TypeScript as the example. The first phase will cover the foundation for your learning project. Think of this as vision, timeframe, timeline, and organization. In the phase after, the focus will be staying on track and I\u2019ll discuss aspects related to accountability, momentum, sharing, and focus. In the final phase of the journey, the goal is to finish strong and cross the finishline. There, I\u2019ll talk about practice, confidence, vocabulary, and depth. Make your Map The first step is to make your map. This will help answer questions like: What does it mean to \u201clearn [insert thing]\u201c? How long will the project take? What are the expected outcomes? How am I going to organize my learning project? Write a Clear Vision For the vision, define your project and use the Objective Key Results (OKRs) framework. If you aren\u2019t familiar, this was popularized by the book \u201dMeasure What Matters\u201d and is used at companies like Google and Intuit. First, define what you expect to achieve. In my TypeScript learning project, I wrote: Learn TypeScript deeply and become the [Company] \u201cin-house expert\u201d That will be your Objective. Next, figure out how you\u2019re going to measure it. We refer to these as the Key Results. Continuing with my previous project, I wrote: Read \u201cProgramming TypeScript\u201d by Boris Cherny Read the Official TypeScript Handbook Produce small code examples for all concepts Contribute to TypeScript, the language Contribute to typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet Don\u2019t rush through this part. Spend some time thinking about your objective and what you need to achieve to get there. Completing your key results should allow you to confidently say you\u2019ve completed your objective. With this vision in mind, you now have clarity on it means when you say \u201clearn [X]\u201d and you know what you expect to achieve. Establish a Timeframe You don\u2019t want to be racing on this map forever. You need to be realistic and ask yourself how much time you have for this. Estimating time to complete tasks is hard. You can use what I like to call the Timeframe Formula: Take the length of months you want to work on this, multiple by 4 to give the amount in weeks. Then multiple it by the number of hours per week that you want to dedicate. For example, when I did a similar project, I gave myself 3 months with 8 hours per week. Using the Timeframe Formula, you get: 3 months x 4 weeks/month x 8 hours/week = 96 hours total. You now have your timeframe. Use this to set expectations on how much time you plan to dedicate each week. Build a Timeline The next thing you need to add to your map is a timeline. Think of this as a week by week calendar. The timeframe answers the question of how long and the timeline answers the what will I do each week. It helps you think less because you will already know what to do for that week. It won\u2019t be perfect. You may need to readjust, but you will have removed friction. An example: Week 1 (June 1) Programming TypeScript Chapter 1 - Introduction Chapter 2 - TypeScript: a 10_000 foot view Book exercises Chapter 3 - All About Types Book exercises Official TypeScript Handbook Basic Types Variable Declarations You know yourself best. Think back to the Timeframe Formula. The example estimated 8hrs/week and 12 weeks in total. Knowing how fast you work (i.e. read, code, etc.), you would adjust accordingly. A complete timeline would have all the weeks filled out. Two important tips: Leave ~10% buffer towards the end Give yourself some breathing room Life comes up and you may fall behind. That\u2019s where the buffer comes in! Some weeks, you may find that you complete everything in 6 hours. No need to fill those two other hours if you don\u2019t want to. Reward yourself with rest. With a timeline, you are good to go! Keep it Organized You want to stay organized on this journey. That means a place to keep track of your timeline, log any notes or things you learn, and have visual indicators for the progress you\u2019re making. I use Notion for this because it supports project management well. I make a place for the project. I add the timeline and use checkboxes. Then, I check them off as I go and take notes as I\u2019m learning. Here is a non-exhaustive list of tools you might want to check out: Notion Trello Asana GitHub Projects Basecamp You could also use an analog tool such as a pen and paper. Stay on Track Now that we have our map, we are ready for the next phase: stay on track. In this phase, the goal is to focus on developing the systems that will help you stay accountable, build momentum, share with others and, stay focused. Keep Yourself Accountable You always want to stay accountable for your project. Think of this as your race crew. They make sure you\u2019re fueled, your tires are rotated, you\u2019re hydrated, and you\u2019re ready to finish the race. We want a similar type of support and accountability. It could be: a group of friends a family member a friend online All you need is at least one person with whom you can share updates. They don\u2019t have to know TypeScript or even know how to code. But they do need to be someone with whom you can check-in regularly. For TypeScript, I recommend looking for 2-3 people who will join you in your TypeScript journey. I would post: on Twitter, using the #100DaysOfCode or #CodeNewbie hashtags on Dev.to, using the #typescript and #discuss tags to start a discussion and share your project on the TypeScript Discord For your own project, come up with a similar list of options. Explore them all. See where you find the most success and stick with it. 2-3 people is ideal, but at least 1 other person works fine. Build Momentum You want momentum. Momentum will keep you going on the track and heading towards the finish line. Think small wins, milestones and success spirals. Small wins are the little accomplishments that we oftentimes take for granted. Examples are things like learning a new word or understanding a concept. Celebrate these. Milestones are the next step up. These can either be date-based or achievement-based. Date-based would be hitting the 1-month mark in your 3-month timeframe for your learning project. Achievement-based would be finishing one of your key results. Either way, these are things to be celebrated and help you sustain the momentum. Success spiral is a term I first heard in Motivation Hack by Nick Winter. It\u2019s the idea that you set yourself up for success for starting small and moving outwards, like a spiral. In this case with TypeScript, maybe you say, \u201cI\u2019m going to write one line of TypeScript a day.\u201d Sounds trivial, right? Good, it should. You start there, establish the habit, then build upwards and outwards. Upwards meaning you continue doing it every day. Outwards meaning you increase the lines of code (without losing the habit). Share with Others Yoda quote, \"Always pass on what you have learned.\" One of the most important parts of staying on track is sharing with others and Learning in Public. There are various mediums you can choose from for sharing: Tweets Blog Posts Podcasts Videos Tutorials Courses Any of these ways work - and there are probably more I didn\u2019t list. This will aid your project for a few reasons: Help you retain what you\u2019re learning Build expertise in the area Meet others who are learning When I was learning TypeScript, I tweeted as I learned. Not only did I meet other TypeScript community members, but people corrected me or taught me new things. Towards the end, people started tweeted me asking for TypeScript help. I didn\u2019t always know the answer, but my sharing with others and learning in public helped me build reputation and credibility. I even ended up attracting the attention of an editor for a tech blog who paid me to write a few TypeScript articles. As you can see, it pays to share with others. Keep Your Focus The last piece I want to touch on for staying on track is keeping your focus. To stay on track, you have to keep yourself focused. The first and foremost is limit your focus. Ideally, learning TypeScript is your main focus. I wouldn\u2019t suggest doing this and learning Rust or another language or something else. Keeping your attention on one project increases the likelihood you\u2019ll stay on track. The other thing you might want to try is deep work. An idea by Cal Newport, it\u2019s where you create an environment that lets you focus on that project for a certain amount of time (such as 1 hour or more) without distractions. Figure out when you\u2019re most productive. For me, it\u2019s in the morning before work. I wake up early, go through my routine, and then spend some time learning. Lastly, find tools to help you stay focused. I am a big fan of the Pomodoro Technique. I have an app called Stretchly that reminds me to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes and a 5-minute break every 40 minutes. This allows me to focus for that period and then rest. It then repeats itself like a cycle. Cross the Finishline The last and final leg of this learning journey is cross the finishline. You should make it there and feel accomplished. Here, you want to use systems that will help you practice, build confidence, remember vocabulary, and go for depth. Practice Learning means nothing without practice. With your new TypeScript knowledge, you can build projects or contribute to open source. This is where the application phase of the learning cycle appears. It doesn\u2019t matter what you build, but that the act of building happens. When I was learning, I followed a tutorial to build a tiny compiler. It was written in JavaScript, but I did it in TypeScript. This forced me to figure out things on my own. If you\u2019re learning something related to code, another idea is contributing to open source. Remember our key results? Here\u2019s two of them that apply here: Contribute to TypeScript, the language Contribute to typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet For things not related to code, ask yourself, \u201cHow can I practice what I\u2019ve learned?\u201d If you are having trouble, consult your community. Ask on Twitter (people love to share their advice). Practice is where you learn the most. Build Confidence You want to build confidence in whatever you\u2019re learning. This will make you feel comfortable using your new knowledge. In the case of TypeScript, you want to build TypeScript Confidence. There are various ways to do this including: teaching others sharing (as we said before) reviewing what you\u2019ve learned helping others Many of these things translate over to other topics as well. The main thing is to feel confident in using your new skills or knowledge. Don\u2019t Skip Vocab Vocabulary is often overlooked. Don\u2019t skip out on it! It helps build confidence and it will solidify what you know. It\u2019s also a great tool to fight imposter syndrome. Knowing the vocabulary will allow you to build expertise. To learn and remember vocabulary, use a spaced-repetition system such as Anki. I used it with my TypeScript learning project. You can use it to remember things such as: terminology concepts patterns syntax Take the thing you\u2019re learning, break it down into pieces and then build a list of vocabulary or concepts around those. Study these. This will benefit you in the long-run. Go for Depth The last thing in this phase is going for depth. Deep learning leads to deep understanding. There are two techniques you can use to deepen what you learn. The first is called the Feynman Technique. Take a concept you are learning, such as type inference in TypeScript and explain it as you would to a seven-year-old. The idea is that if you can\u2019t do that, you don\u2019t know the concept well enough. Note: the age of the person to whom you\u2019re explaining your learning concept can vary. Focus on being able to explain something you understand to someone with little knowledge or context. The second technique I want to point out is called Ultralearning. In his book, Scott Young explains Ultralearning as, a strategy for aggressive, self-directed learning. \u2014Scott Young Think of it as taking something, being aggressive with how much or how fast you can learn it, and diving deep. You can use this with your learning projects. While you\u2019re learning, take notes of questions you have or concepts you don\u2019t quite understand. Then at the end of your project, see if those questions remain. If they do, start a new learning project and focus on answering those questions. As you can imagine, if you do this with a topic, you\u2019ll have several learning projects and soon start to develop expertise in this subject. It\u2019s very powerful. Summary The most important takeaway is this: use systems to help you learn better and faster. They will serve as your map, keep you on track and help you cross the finishline. If you were to do this with a programming language like TypeScript, you would develop a proficiency, hopefully even expertise in the language. The next steps are to go out and use your new knowledge in the world! See what you can build. Find ways to help other people. And if you\u2019re ambitious, I challenge you to go deeper after you finish your first learning project. Use this framework and do another round of it. See how much you can learn! You\u2019ll never know the opportunities that may show up as a result. Tweak this learning framework to your liking and try it out on other projects - even non-technical ones. Adjust as needed. See how it works.

It\u2019s fun to see what others use and share my own setup. To make things easier, I\u2019ve broken it into two categories: gear and software. Gear This is a mix of personal and work gear. Some I bought myself (new or used) and other parts were paid for by my company. Desk Setup Here is everything related to how my desk is set up at home. Desk I use a standing desk, specifically the Autonomous SmartDesk2 - Home Office. Chair With a work stipend, I purchased an Autonomous ErgoChair 2. Laptop For work, I have a MacBook Pro 16-inch and at home, I use an iMac or a 13-inch MacBook. Laptop Stand At home, I\u2019m usually working with one monitor (laptop) so I use a laptop stand to not have to bend over. I invested in the Roost a while back. It\u2019s a bit overpriced, but lightweight and does the job. Now, I might look at one of the competitors if I were to buy one today. Keyboard I switch between an Apple Magic Keyboard (personal) and a Kinesis Freestyle Edge (work). The Edge is a split keyboard and I am a huge fan! Mouse I switch between an Apple Magic Trackpad (personal) and an MX Logitech Vertical Mouse (work). Microphone I use Shure BETA 87A (thanks to my friends at egghead). Microphone Boom Arm I started streaming for work so I invested in a boom arm and went with the Rode PSA1. Big fan! Webcam Part of what I do for work is record videos so they let me buy a new webcam: Logitech BRIO. I am very happy with it! Works well for streaming and video meetings. Streamdeck Again, I stared streaming for work so they let me buy an Elegato Stream Deck 15-key. Software Most of this is software I use to work efficiently and productively. I\u2019ve switched back and forth between a lot of tools, but this is what I\u2019m using currently. Editor and Terminal IDE I switched from Sublime to VS Code years ago and I can\u2019t see myself going back. I used to use the Sublime keybindings in VS Code. However, last year I switched to the Vim keybindings. It took some time to reach the same speed, but I would say I\u2019ve surpassed my previous speed and added a few new tricks thanks to Vim. Terminal I use iTerm2. A friend told me about it a while ago. I switched to it and haven\u2019t looked back. Theme I switch between themes. Right now, I\u2019m using Noctis and happy with it. zsh and prezto I use zsh and prezto on top of that. Starship I found this by luck while exploring Rust. If anything, it lets you easily customize emojis used within your terminal for different programs. Productivity Random desktop apps that I use for productivity or other reasons. Notion I am HUGE Notion fan! I pay for the personal plan to get unlimited blocks and use it both for personal and work. I use it for task/project management and structure it using the P.A.R.A. method. Trello Trello has a special place in my heart. I have a few boards to keep track of project ideas and other personal stuff. ScreenFlow Similar to the microphone from egghead, I use ScreenFlow to record and edit my videos (mostly screencasts). Gifox 2 For PRs and showing things to friends or coworkers, I use Gifox 2. I paid for the pro version and use it on both my personal and work machine. Stretchly Stretchly is a handy app for reminding me to take breaks. Clippy or Flycut A coworker once told me about his clipboard history app. I thought it was genius and since then have used both Flycut and Clippy. Alfred As of writing this, I haven\u2019t caved to buy the Alfred Powerpack (though I may\u2026), I mainly use it because it\u2019s faster than Spotlight on macOS and does some cool things like let you shutdown your mac by typing \u201cshutdown.\u201d Rocket I like emojis a lot. I bought Rocket and am a huge fan. Flux Although maOS now has a built-in dimming feature, I don\u2019t find it to be as great as Flux so I use Flux to dim my screen/remove bluelight as the sunsets. Keeping You Awake Keeping You Awake is a fantastic app for preventing your mac from going to sleep. Spectacle and Rectangle For window management, I use Spectacle (personal) or Rectangle (work).","title":"Uses"},{"location":"public/programming/armanriazi-movies-reactjs/","text":"online: armanriazi-movies-reactjs.herokuapp Improved speed and performance.

For part of my job, I have been focused on developing my own understanding of the space. I work within the DevTools pillar and focus primarily on programming languages. My main priority for H1 of 2020 has been Rust. The goal of this article is: To paint a high-level overview of the ecosystem The article covers various aspects of the ecosystem including community, companies using the language, selling points, etc. Overview \u00b6 One of the hardest parts of understanding a programming language is setting the boundaries for what you encapsulate as part of and not part of the ecosystem. I gathered input coworkers and mentors in order to set the criteria for this project. For our purposes, I choose to limit it to the following areas, which you\u2019ll see below. For each section, you can expect: A brief description of how I defined the section Key highlights from the ecosystem for that area of the ecosystem Academic Research \u00b6 Things that fall under this category might be research papers, academic presentations, and anything related. It was difficult to find much in this area, but here are a few highlights: Memory-Safety Challenge Considered Solved? An Empirical Study with All Rust CVEs What can the programming language Rust do for astrophysics? RustBelt: Securing the Foundations of the RustProgramming Language Rust-Like Borrowing with 2nd-Class Values (Short Paper) Safe Systems Programming in Rust:The Promise and the Challenge Fearless Concurrency? Understanding Concurrent Programming Safety in Real-World Rust Software As you can tell from skimming the headings, researchers are looking at Rust\u2019s use cases, security, memory management, type-safety and concurrency. It\u2019s unfortunate there isn\u2019t an easy way to stay on top of academic research within Rust. Demographics \u00b6 When you look at the programming language, how do you know who is using it? What industries do they work in? Fortunately, the Rust Survey 2019 Results provides insight related to demographics. Based on the results, here are the key highlights: Respondents\u2019 top five languages: English, Chinese, German, French and Japanese Top five industries using Rust: Backend Web Applications, Distributed Systems, Embedded Devices, IT and Network Programming Top three titles for Rust users: Programmer/Software Engineer, Systems Architect, Web Developer/Front End Developer It\u2019s unfortunate that we do not have more information related to demographics such as gender, ethnicity, race, etc. There was an attempt to gather some of this information in the 2016 survey . Know that this section contains a small glimpse into the people of the Rust and is far from complete or representative of the ecosystem. Community \u00b6 Community itself is a huge category. I tried my best to break it into subcategories for things that might fit here. In general, think of this area as the various places where members of the community congregate (online and in-person), groups who write code, and foundations. These are a combination of chat platforms, but also places where updates are shared with the community. Here are some worth noting: Chat Platforms Discord (35,597 members total) The Rust Programming Language (25,135 members) Rust Programming Language Community Server (10,462 members) Rust lang Slack (3,046 people) Rust Team Zulip (655 people) (mainly focused on people who work on Rust itself) Conferences FOSDEM RustConf Rusty Days RustFest Netherlands Rust + GNOME Hackfest Rust Latam RustLab Oxidize List of 2020 events on the Rust lang blog Core contributors Governance - all the different core team members associated with each team GitHub Rustlang org members GitHub committers - over 2k people have contributed to /rust repo Rust team alumni - people who worked on a Rust team previously Forums Users forum (14.2k) Internals forum (6.8k) r/rust -Reddit (100k people) Meetups Stats (meetups with the topic \u201crust\u201d ) 73,706 members 1,749 interested 204 Meetups 145 cities 42 countries Groups (not all listed, some highlights) Desert Rust (Phoenix, AZ) Minneapolis Rust Meetup Rusty Bay Area Meetup Rust Bangalore Rust Berlin Rust in Blockchain Rust Los Angeles Rust London User Group Rust Dev in Mountain View Meetup Rust Denver Rust NYC Rust Nairobi Rust Paris San Diego Rust Seattle Rust Meetup Utah Rust Miscellaneous RFCs (2.9k stars) - where technical decisions are made in regards to Rust This Week in Rust - weekly newsletter Programs Rust\u2019s Reach (currently on hold due to lack of funding and people) - \u201cmentorship like program between participants from URGs and Rust team members\u201d Rust Bridge (1 chapter) - \u201ca workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community.\u201d *These stats were taken on 5/19/2020 As you can see, the community category extends itself across many platforms and mediums online. It\u2019s easy to overwhelm oneself with all the places you can go to get involved. The beautiful part is that there is no shortage of finding ways to meet others within the community. *For the data in the \u201cMeetups > Stats\u201d category, you\u2019ll notice that it includes some meetups that are not specifically for Rust so take that number with a grain of salt. Companies \u00b6 It would be impossible to list all the companies that use Rust. This is a sub-selection of notable companies (more well-known) that are using or investing in Rust, ideally along with articles where they share how they\u2019re using it or helping the ecosystem: Amazon AWS is sponsoring the Rust programming language - AWS Open Source Blog (October 2019) \u201c\u2026 AWS staff open-sourced a virtualization technology named Firecracker that was coded primarily in Rust \u201d - zdnet.com article (October 2019) \u201c_As Rust starts to take up a larger chunk of Amazon\u2019s backend code, the company is making sure the project has the means to continue to evolve and fix security issues.\u201d _-_ _ zdnet.com article (October 2019) AWS sponsors RustConf - AWS Open Source Blog (2018 - 2020) Apple Rust for server-side Linux on Apple Cloud Traffic (March 2020) Atlassian (makers of Jira) Use Rust in the backend for analyzing terabytes of source code Cloudflare Cloudflare uses Rust in production for WebAssembly edge computing as well as a lot of foundational infrastructure (2018-2019) Discord \u201cWhy Discord is switching from Go to Rust\u201d - (February 2020) 11.9K claps \u201cUsing Rust to Scale Elixir for 11 Million Concurrent Users\u201d - (May 2019) 6.4K claps Dropbox Dropbox is highlighted on the /production page of the rust-lang.org website - (currently - March 2020) Go-ing to Rust: Optimizing Storage at Dropbox - (November 2017) Dropbox is mentioned on official Rust lang blog - (May 2017) \u201cThe Epic Story of Dropbox\u2019s Exodus From the Amazon Cloud Empire\u201d - (March 2016) Facebook Developers have named Rust their most-loved programming language five years in a row.

Thankfully, the community resource rust-web-framework-comparison made this research easy. Here is a long list: Client frameworks actix-web ( homepage / repository / api docs ) reqwest (- / repository / documentation ) hyper ( homepage / repository / documentation ) jsonrpc (- / repository / documentation ) Frontend frameworks (WASM) stdweb ( - / repository / documentation ) A standard library for the client-side Web yew ( homepage / repository / documentation ) - A frontend framework inspired by Elm and React (based on stdweb) percy ( homepage / repository / - ) - A modular toolkit for building isomorphic web apps seed ( homepage / repository / - ) - A Rust framework for creating web apps draco ( - / repository / documentation ) - A frontend framework inspired by Redux and Elm smithy ( homepage - / repository / - documentation ) - A front-end framework squark ( - / repository / documentation ) - Rust frontend framework, for web browser and more. willow ( homepage - / repository / - ) - A frontend framework inspired by Elm dodrio ( - / repository / documentation ) - A fast, bump-allocated virtual DOM library. dominator ( - / repository / documentation - Zero cost declarative DOM library using FRP signals for Rust!. mika ( homepage / repository / - ) - A signal-based framework for building front-end app, it tries to help, but may cause annoyances.

It\u2019s difficult to know what to choose. However, it\u2019s also a benefit having the ability to try out various solutions and see what works best. Learning \u00b6 Similar to the Community category, learning can be quite difficult to narrow down. I have tried my best to highlight the main areas and a few examples for each category. Know that this list is non-exhaustive and more a brief survey into this area of the ecosystem.

Systems Programming with Rust (at a conference) Packages \u00b6 One of the most important aspects of a programming language ecosystem is a way to share code with others. In the Rust ecosystem, the most common way is through packages, more commonly referred to as \u201ccrates\u201d. Below are links to two places where you can share code (your own private registry or the public one): Cloudsmith - create your own private cargo registry crates.io - \u201cThe Rust community\u2019s crate registry\u201d libs.rs - \u201cFast, lightweight, opinionated, unofficial alternative to crates.io\u201d Platforms \u00b6 The objective for this section was to figure out where Rust code can run. What platforms or systems are people targeting or building for? We saw a few of these mentioned in the Frameworks section. Here are the most common ones I could find (and some examples): Browser WebAssembly Wasm-bindgem Rust to WASM + Next CLI Apps clap Build binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows Embedded Devices https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded Operating System Writing an OS in Rust Mobile Apps Building an iOS App in Rust, Part 1: Getting Started with Rust Example project for building a library for iOS + Android in Rust Server Deploying to Heroku Anywhere? Rust Once, Run Everywhere Selling Points \u00b6 Everyone will have their favorite reasons for using one language over another. I tried to select articles related to the selling points, but also highlight features of the language brought up by people who advocate for it. Articles How often does Rust change? Rust programming language: Seven reasons why you should learn it in 2019 What is Rust and why is it so popular? Why Rust? Why should I use Rust? Features Borrow checker (\u201c Rust has a static garbage collector \u201d) Community Ownership model Package manager Performance Productivity Excellent documentation Built-in tools (cargo, fmt, clippy) Smart memory-management Type system Other Used by big companies (talk about Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.) *Note: this section also piggybacks off the Use Cases section (coming up). Beyond this, I would encourage you to read the results from the Rust 2019 survey which asked \u201cWhy not use Rust\u201d . Not all points relate to selling points, but it may provide insight into what would sell people on using Rust if these things were fixed. Tools \u00b6 The tools used for writing and using the programming language is an aspect we sometimes forget. This affects the developer experience and can drive or hinder the ecosystem. Here are some highlights: Benchmarking criterion - Statistics-driven Microbenchmarking Built-in testing support Cargo Build (macOS, Windows, Linux) Clippy Rustdoc rustfmt IDE support https://www.rust-lang.org/tools Hover over documentation in editor Rust Playground - test code online, share with others Use Cases \u00b6 Deriving some of the tops results from the Rust Survey 2019 , here are the main industries/applications that responded in the survey and are using Rust: Top 10 from survey Backend Web Applications Distributed Systems Embedded Devices Enterprise Software Frontend Web Applications Internet of Things IT Network Programming Security Technology Other Blockchain ( Libra Move ) Solana Deno - uses JavaScript engine written in Rust 1.0 Announcement Summary \u00b6 Reflecting on what we have covered thus far, we can see that the Rust ecosystem is well-developed and growing. This is not a conclusive/comprehensive list of the ecosystem or the companies using it. From my knowledge, Rust is used at big companies such as Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google. They are all investing in the language. We\u2019ve covered the ecosystem from a bird\u2019s-eye view as we see it today. Here are the main things to walk away with: Overview The community is ubiquitous both online and in-person There is no shortage of books or references to read from the official Rust groups Rust can be used for writing web, mobile, and CLI apps, servers embedded devices, and OS\u2019s Rust is fast, well-documented, type-safe, manages memory efficiently, but has a steep learning curve What\u2019s next? \u00b6 We plan to use this information when making decisions and building strategies for us to get involved with the Rust ecosystem. If you\u2019d like to collaborate with us, please reach out to me over DMs on Twitter ! We would love to work with you. Thank you for reading!

This might be the first time we meet so I thought I\u2019d start this post off with a short introduction. I\u2019m Joe and previously I worked with JavaScript building web apps and mobile apps. Now, I\u2019m learning Rust both for personal reasons and work-related reasons. One of my primary focuses for this half of the year is Rust! Beyond that though, I am personally excited about Rust because: it\u2019s exciting it\u2019s type-safe (Yay, coming from TypeScript!) it\u2019s performant it has excellent documentation it has a strong community I dabbled a bit about a year ago doing some exercises on exercism but now learning Rust is a high priority. You might be interested in Rust because you can build: CLI tools Web apps (compile to WASM, or Web Assembly) Web servers And many other exciting things! For March, I decided to put together a plan to learn a little bit of Rust. The purpose is to start building projects with Rust and get involved in the community. Here\u2019s what the plan looks like: Learn enough Rust to be dangerous, measured by: ability to understand and explain basic concepts in Rust ability to contribute code to an open source project in the Rust community ability to build and ship a small project in Rust I\u2019ve taken these objectives and broken them out into actionable tasks. They are as follows: Read Chapters 1-3 of the Rust Lang Book (by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community) Write 3 blog posts Contribute to an open source project (bug fix or docs) Build a small web server app (bunny1 clone) This is the first blog post in the series, which covers my notes and thoughts on Chapter 1 of the Rust Lang Book. If you read Chapter 1 and would like to discuss, let\u2019s have a conversation! Tweet @ me or shoot me a DM on Twitter. Notes on Chapter 1 The first chapter in the Rust Lang Book is a friendly introduction to Rust. It covers enough of the basics to get started. You download Rust and then write your first program, which prints \u201cHello, World!\u201d Here are things I wrote down while reading the first chapter online: rustup is the preferred version manager Coming from the JavaScript world, I\u2019m used to scouring the internet for a decent node version manager. The common goto is nvm. Lucky for us, the Rust team supplies an official version manager and it\u2019s called rustup. Free, offline docs - out-of-the-box I noted this after rereading some of Chapter 1. rustup comes with a version of the docs that you can launch and read offline \ud83d\ude31 How genius is that?! rustup doc cargo commands are like npm commands Similar to how we use npm in the JS world for packaging and building our projects, cargo serves a similar purpose for Rust. Rust leans towards snake_case In JS, I used camelCase when naming things. It seems like the Rust community leans towards snake_case. This was evident during the hello world exercise. We named the project directory hello_world. My assumption may be premature. semicolons have meaning There is a great debate in JS - semicolons or no semicolons? While the choice is mainly conventional in JavaScript, Rust is a bit different. Most of the time, you\u2019ll use them to declare the end of an expression. Here\u2019s an example: // Rust example println!(\"Hello, world!\"); Like all good rules in programming languages, there is an exception! If you don\u2019t include it in a code block, it returns the last line. Here\u2019s what that looks like: // Rust if x < 5 { x + 1 } There is no semicolon but this will still return x plus 1. Reminds me of the arrow function implicit return in JavaScript: // JavaScript const firstName = () => 'Rusty' Rust has an official code formatter If you\u2019re not familiar with the Prettier, it\u2019s an opinionated code formatter. It supports a lot of different languages. I believe it\u2019s the most used one in JavaScript. A positive note about Rust is that they have an official formatter called rustfmt. And even better, the Rust book says, The Rust team plans to eventually include this tool with the standard Rust distribution Official formatting - hooray! Another thing we don\u2019t have to worry about. Rust uses macros I wasn\u2019t familiar with this because JavaScript does not have them. They look like functions, but according to Computer Hope, macros are \u201ca tool that allows a developer to re-use code.\u201d I thought it was like a function, but they have a note saying, A macro is not the same as a function. Functions require special instructions and computational overhead to safely pass arguments and return values. A macro is a way to repeat frequently-used lines of code. Here is an example using the println! macro in Rust: // Rust println!(\"Howdy, friend!\"); The \u201c!\u201d in \u201cprintln!\u201d means it\u2019s a macro After learning about macros, I asked myself, \u201cBut how do you know if it\u2019s a local function vs. macro?\u201d Then I realized, it\u2019s the !. That\u2019s the pattern to look for. \u201cBinary executable\u201d is fancy terms for \u201ccomputer-ready-file\u201d I\u2019ve heard the term \u201cbinary executable.\u201d I know what \u201cbinary\u201d means and I know what \u201cexecutable\u201d means, but I highlighted this anyway. In layperson terms, it means the computer can read and execute it without anyone\u2019s help. Compile before you run, you must When I learned JavaScript, I never fully understood the whole compiled vs interpreted lingo. Well, now I have a basic understanding. In most cases, a JavaScript engine (like V8) \u201ccompiles JavaScript code into machine code at execution by implementing a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler.\u201d Notice though, the JS engine does this, not the developer. In Rust (and many other languages), there is a compile step that you, the developer, must do. So you must compile your code before you can run it. Ahead-of-time compilation is awesome I hadn\u2019t previously heard this phrase \u201cahead-of-time compilation\u201d but now I get what it is and why it\u2019s awesome. You compile your program and it outputs a file. Because you compiled \u201cahead of time\u201d \ud83d\ude09 you can send it to a friend who can then run it on their machine without having Rust. That\u2019s amazing! At least coming from JS/Python. With Rust, it\u2019s already ready to go! cargo new, what it do? Going back to our npm comparison, it is like npm init and creates a new Rust project. What makes it even better though is that it includes a .gitignore file for you. It\u2019s fantastic. crates are like npm packages Crates are bundled up pieces of code. Similar to the JS world, you install a package from npm, you do the same with Rust, but with crates. I love the term \u201ccrate.\u201d It\u2019s kind of fun to say and isn\u2019t an everyday term like \u201cpackages\u201d. The official crates registry is crates.io. The other differentiating factor is that crates.io is \u201cmanaged by members of the Crates.io and Rust core teams.\u201d I hope this means it\u2019s more sustainable and community-driven. Rust encourages project folder structure Coming from the JS world, you can put your files in any directory you want (most of the time). You then tell your bundler where to look. What I like about Rust is that it encourages a project folder structure out the gate. According to the book, \u201cCargo expects your source files to live inside the src directory.\u201d This is great! One less thing for us to think about. You can, of course, override this by setting the path value in your cargo.toml (I googled out of curiosity). cargo check - \u201cAm I doing this right?\u201d cargo check will check your source code without building it. This is a good way to iterate quickly. cargo build \u2014release - \u201cShip it!\u201d This one is more of a reminder for me. When you\u2019re ready to ship your code to production, add the release flag to your build step: cargo build --release fn: function keyword is only two letters In JavaScript, we have to use seven keystrokes to declare a function. That\u2019s a lot! But in Rust, we only need to write two: fn. How cool is that? We\u2019re five keystrokes richer in Rust. What\u2019s next? As previously mentioned, next up for me is Chapter 2 of the Rust Lang Book. Here, they\u2019ll walk us through programming a guessing game - hooray! I\u2019m excited about this. The next blog post in this series will cover my notes on building my first real project in Rust. Until then, happy coding my fellow Rustaceans! \ud83e\udd80 P.S. - I included a glossary and cheatsheet at the end here. Enjoy! Glossary I covered a decent number of new words (at least for me) in this post. I find it helpful to remind myself what they each mean.

The process of increasing demand, the need for intelligent supply and demand cycle, better resource management, better utilization of resources is necessary. The results indicate competition from the cycle leads to a complex challenge for selecting and scheduling tasks to provide composite services in the Cloud. One of the most important issues in this field is Load Balancing. How to choose idle resources from a set of resources, overcoming compositional constraints, determines the importance of scheduling and resource allocation. These are NP-Hard issues. State-of-the-art architecture in the field of Cloud Computing for the implementation of Scientific Workflows that can be implemented in a distributed manner is becoming increasingly considered in other sciences related to Cloud Computing. The distinction and competition of Cloud Service Providers to publish services with more profit and better quality to customers are summarized in features such as \"Scalability, Stability, High availability, Fault tolerance.\" By providing new solutions and services for using specialists in other sciences, we can see the utilization of Cloud Computing Infrastructure and services in the fields of industry, commerce, health, and emergency applications. The possibility of conducting Scientific Workflows using Virtual Machines\" and Containers is a goal that has been addressed in the proposed architecture. The Load Balancing in the form of Containers at the level of Virtual Machines using the Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) algorithm is one of the important goals and issues that have been covered and solutions for utilization as much as possible has been explained. According to previous studies, there is no comprehensive or stable architecture that can balance Scientific Workflows using the algorithm ACO at the container virtualization level. By providing a simulator environment and testing several samples with different parameters then estimated the efficiency of the ACO and default algorithm of [[Cloudsim]], ie First-Come-First-Serve(FCFS). In the case of fifty, hundred Samples of Montage Scientific Workflow, which is considered as the average load rate, balancing the workload of the Containers on the Virtual Machine with the ACO has better results than the FCFS. If the value of the beta parameter of the ACO is assigned by zero, the algorithm will be trapped to the local optimal. In the case of a thousand sample, which is interpreted as a large amount of workload, if a Cybershake Workflow is used finally the results will be the same in all performance evaluation indicators.

The process of increasing demand, the need for intelligent supply and demand cycle, better resource management, better utilization of resources is necessary. The results indicate competition from the cycle leads to a complex challenge for selecting and scheduling tasks to provide composite services in the Cloud. One of the most important issues in this field is Load Balancing. How to choose idle resources from a set of resources, overcoming compositional constraints, determines the importance of scheduling and resource allocation. These are NP-Hard issues. State-of-the-art architecture in the field of Cloud Computing for the implementation of Scientific Workflows that can be implemented in a distributed manner is becoming increasingly considered in other sciences related to Cloud Computing. The distinction and competition of Cloud Service Providers to publish services with more profit and better quality to customers are summarized in features such as \"Scalability, Stability, High availability, Fault tolerance.\" By providing new solutions and services for using specialists in other sciences, we can see the utilization of Cloud Computing Infrastructure and services in the fields of industry, commerce, health, and emergency applications. The possibility of conducting Scientific Workflows using Virtual Machines\" and Containers is a goal that has been addressed in the proposed architecture.
