> I was walking past to a park, heading toward the city center. I saw my friend and then she suggested creating pages like this exactly.
> I appreciate her. In my opinion, most developers encounter a lot of information who work in the scope of information technology
> (e.g. web developers, blockchain specialists, DevOps engineers) are learning or working.
> They spend a lot of time on it that is not seen in comparison to manual jobs! I prefer to create a knowledge base for myself and then share it. So the philosophy of creating this page is to solve this issue.

> Through to my experiences.
